# horse-racing-game

The game will generate 20 horses at first. Then you can watch the race within 6 rounds and each round will have a winner. 

Here is the first UI Design on Figma for this project, designed by me.

Optional Interactivity for the game: Each rounds' first 3 winner horses will increase their Performance Point from 5 to 15 points and the rest of the racing horses will lose from 1 to 7 points.
